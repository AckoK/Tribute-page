            <p cite="https://esenin-museum.ru/en/portfolios/esenin"><strong>Sergei Alexandrovich Yesenin</strong>, also spelled as <strong>Esenin</strong>, lived a short life. Over barely thirty years, he wrote hundreds of beautiful poems in both short and epic verse, along with literary prose and a vast collection
                of letters containing his thoughts on spirituality, philosophy, religion, Russia and the Revolution. His brief, bright life left has left a deep mark on Russian literature and in every human heart.

                <p>Sergei Yesenin was born in Konstantinovo in Ryazan Governorate of the Russian Empire to a peasant family. Both his parents spent most of their time looking for work, so at age two Sergei was moved to the nearby village Matovo, to join
                    Titovs, his relatively well-off maternal grandparents, who essentially raised him. He
                    <strong><em>started to read aged five, and at nine began to write poetry</em></strong>, inspired originally by chastushkas and folklore, provided mostly by the grandmother whom he also remembered as a highly religious woman.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1912</strong> - His first publications came after his move to Moscow – pastoral poems in a children’s magazine.</li>
                    <li><strong>1915</strong> - Yesenin left Moscow, and his civil marriage to <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/names/anna_jesenina" target="_blank">Anna Izryadovna</a>, for St. Petersburg. Yesenin’s poems began to be published in respected
                        in poetry journals, and he started getting invited to literary salons.</li>
                    <li><strong>1917</strong> - He married actress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinaida_Reich" target="blank">Zinaida Reich</a>. Completing poems “Otchar,” “Advent,” “Transformation,” and “Inonia.”
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1918</strong> - Return to Moscow. Here, with Marienhof, Shershenevich, Kusikov, and Gruzinov, Yesenin founded the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/Imaginism" target="blank">Imagist movement</a>, a poetry style distinguished
                        by its use of complex metaphor.</li>
                    <li><strong>1921</strong> - Yesenin met <a href="https://globallovemuseum.net/portfolio-items/sergei-yesenin-and-isadora-duncan/" target="_blank">Isadora Duncan</a>, the American founder of modern dance. While abroad, Yesenin worked on
                        the cycle “Moscow Taverns,” the dramatic poem “A Country of Scoundrels,” and the first draft of “The Black Man.” “Hooligan’s Testament” was published in Paris later that year.</li>
                    <li><strong>1923 to 1925</strong> - This last creative period was characterized by a particularly philosophical bent. The poet was looking back on his life’s path, thinking about its meaning, trying to make sense of the events that so
                        transformed his homeland, to find his place in the new Russia. Marriage with Sophia Tolstaya, a granddaughter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" target="_blank">Tolstoy.</a></li>

                <h3 class="section-heading">Cultural impact</h3>
                <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Yesenin">Yesenin's suicide triggered an epidemic of copycat suicides by his mostly female fans. For example, Galina Benislavskaya, his ex-girlfriend, killed herself by his graveside in December 1926. Although he was one of Russia's most popular
                    poets and had been given an elaborate state funeral, some of his writings were banned by the Kremlin during the reigns of Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. Today Yesenin's poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been
                    set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical
                    popular image of the Russian poet. The Ryazan State University is named in his honor.</p>
